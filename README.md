# Getting Started with REACT_TASKER

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run backend`

Runs the json-server on port 5000

#### Note: If the json-server is not started, no tasks will render for apps, regardless of production or development mode.

### `serve -s build -p 8000`

Deploys the app in production mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
